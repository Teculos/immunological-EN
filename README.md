# Package Information and Contact
* Code Tested in: R version 3.6.3 on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
* Prepared by: Tony Culos (tculos@stanford.edu)


# Summary
We introduce the immunological Elastic Net (iEN) which integrates mechanistic immunological knowledge into a machine learning framework. Here we provide code for the application of iEN models and its optimization given a set of hyperparameter values. For a more comprehensive description of this method please see `Integration of Mechanistic Immunological Knowledge into a Machine Learning Pipeline Improves Predictions`.

# Package Installation
Installation of the 'immunological-EN' can be accomplished easiest through the terminal.

1. Download the entire repository into a folder, we suggest naming this folder `iEN` or `immunological-EN` for clarity
1. In the terminal navigate to the previously mentioned folder location and run the following command
```R CMD Build iEN```
Adapt this commond to accomadate whichever folder name was used
1. Next install the `.tar.gz` file which was built
```R CMD INSTALL iEN_0.99.0.tar.gz```

the iEN model and optimization code will now be available in R through the library function `library(iEN)`
